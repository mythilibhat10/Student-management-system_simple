# Student-management-system_simple
This is a simple student management program. The purpose of this program is to give basic knowledge of using Python to create a management project by connecting with MySQL
This was my junior college project and the main purpose of this project was to write 500 lines of code to create any project using python-MsQL connectivity. The code can be further modified and the number of lines can be easily reduced by using different libraries. Here I have used MySQL.connector, platform, and os library for connecting and accessing the data. 
Before executing this code ensure that you have created a dataset that has all the labeled columns required for this project. Once you run this code the new data will be stored in this dataset.
